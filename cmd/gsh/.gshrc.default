# -------- Large Language Model Configuration --------
# - gsh invokes Large Language Models through OpenAI-compatible API
# - You can choose to use Ollama which runs LLM on your local machine
# - You can also use OpenAI or OpenRouter which runs LLM as a cloud service
# - Read the corresponding documentation of the model provider for config values below

# The "fast" model is used for auto suggestion.

# -------- RAG Configuration --------
# gsh uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to get context from the environment and help give accurate results.
#
# Available context types include: 
# - system_info: current OS and architecture
# - working_directory: path of the current working directory
# - git_status: output from `git status`
# - history_concise: a concise version of command history
# - history_verbose: a verbose version of command history
#
# Retrieving more context will generally improve output quality at the cost of using more tokens and increased latency.

# -------- Agent Configuration --------
# Options below control behaviors of the chat agent.

# A JSON array of regex patterns for bash commands that should be considered pre-approved
# Pre-approved commands will be executed without asking for confirmation
#
# This configuration works alongside the file-based authorization system:
# - Patterns defined here are always active (static pre-approval)
# - Additional patterns can be dynamically added to ~/.config/gsh/authorized_commands
#   when you respond with 'a' (always) to command permission prompts
# - Both sources are checked when determining if a command should be auto-approved
#
# Example patterns that get automatically generated when using 'always allow':
# - "^ls.*" (matches any ls command)
# - "^git status.*" (matches git status with any flags)
# - "^npm install.*" (matches npm install commands)
# - "^docker run.*" (matches docker run commands)
